 * between GPU memory, host memory, and storage tiers.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Move-only semantics (no copy constructor/assignment)
 * - Processing counting for safe shared access and eviction prevention
 * - State management (idle, task_created, processing, in_transit) for lifecycle tracking
 * - Delegated tier management to underlying idata_representation
 * - Unique batch ID for tracking and debugging purposes
 * - Lifecycle managed by smart pointers (std::shared_ptr or std::unique_ptr)
 *
 * @note This class is not thread-safe for construction/destruction, but the state management
 *       operations are protected by an internal mutex and thread-safe.
